Google Cloud Identity Access Management (IAM) reporting

Bash script to download IAM roles for the Organization, Folder, and project levels. The current version will display to standard out but could be modified to load into any reporting tool including Big Query for analysis of GCP roles for users and service accounts.

Requirements:
Organizational permission to view IAM policy

Future enhancements:
Option to load into Big query with time partitioning
Enhance granularity by reporting on permissions rather than roles
